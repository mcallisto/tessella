# Path addition

Growing a `Tiling` by adding one polygon at a time is done by:
 
* adding a polygon (of the given number of sides) to a given perimeter edge **pE** `Tiling.EdgeT`

* which -at a lower level- means to add a new path connecting two perimeter nodes **pN1** and **pN2**. The two perimeter nodes are not necessarily the **pE** nodes, since some sides of the polygon could be already existing, shared with other polygons.

In terms of validation of the constraints:

1. A path connecting two nodes, if one of them is not on the perimeter -> the `Tiling` is not valid

2. The path generated by adding a polygon should be checked for possible overlappings, but not for gaps, since is growing the previous valid `Tiling`

3. If **pN1** and **pN2** are adjacent (that is, they are the **pE** nodes) -> the `Tiling` is valid, if there are no overlappings

4. If **pN1** and **pN2** are NOT adjacent, they divide the perimeter in two paths:
 
   * If one of the two is concave, with a constant angle, and the number of edges in the path is compatible with the angle to form a regular polygon -> the `Tiling` is valid, if there are no overlappings
 
   * If not:
 
     * either **pN1** and **pN2** are the diagonal of a square `Tiling` and the path is just one edge: then the square is divided "internally" in two triangles. This means that the path is long just one edge and there are two other perimeter nodes neighbors of both **pN1** and **pN2**

     * or -> the `Tiling` is not valid
